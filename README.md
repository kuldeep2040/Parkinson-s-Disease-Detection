# Parkinson's Disease Detection

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson's disease using a machine learning approach. The dataset is analyzed, visualized, and preprocessed to build a classification model. The `XGBoost Classifier` was used for the prediction, achieving notable accuracy.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: [Parkinson’s Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/174/parkinsons) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Goal**: To predict whether an individual has Parkinson’s disease based on various biomedical voice measurements.
- **Model Used**: XGBoost Classifier.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and standardization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding the data distribution.
- Training and testing using the `XGBoost` model.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
- Visualization of results using heatmaps and other plots.
